# 🚀 GitHub CI/CD Pipeline - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. **Main CI/CD Pipeline** (`ci-cd-pipeline.yml`)
A production-ready GitHub Actions workflow with 8 comprehensive jobs:

#### 🔧 Job 1: Setup & Validation
- Generates dependency cache keys for faster builds
- Sets Python version (3.11)
- Displays workflow metadata

#### 🔍 Job 2: Code Quality & Security
- **Black**: Enforces consistent code formatting
- **isort**: Validates import organization
- **Flake8**: PEP 8 compliance checking
- **Pylint**: Advanced static analysis
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Safety**: Dependency security audits
- Uploads security reports as artifacts (30-day retention)

#### ✅ Job 3: Framework Verification
- Validates all custom libraries import correctly
- Tests APIHealthcareLibrary, DatabaseHealthcareLibrary, PlaywrightHealthcareLibrary
- Ensures framework components are functional

#### 🧪 Job 4: API Tests
- Runs pytest-based API test suite (`test_simple_api.py`)
- Generates HTML and JSON test reports
- Publishes results to GitHub summary
- Supports markers: smoke, api, security
- Uploads test reports as artifacts

#### 🗄️ Job 5: Database Tests
- Spins up PostgreSQL 15 test container
- Validates database connectivity
- Tests DatabaseHealthcareLibrary
- Environment: healthcare_test database

#### 🔗 Job 6: Integration Tests
- Runs full end-to-end scenarios
- Executes only on push/manual triggers
- Tests cross-component integrations
- Uploads integration reports

#### 📊 Job 7: Test Summary
- Aggregates all test results
- Creates GitHub step summary with:
  - Test suite pass/fail status
  - Available artifacts
  - Build information (commit, branch, author)

#### 📧 Job 8: Notifications
- Sends completion notifications
- Displays results for all jobs
- Runs on scheduled and push events

## 📦 Artifacts Generated

Each pipeline run creates downloadable artifacts:

| Artifact | Contains | Retention |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `security-reports` | Bandit security scans, Safety vulnerability reports | 30 days |
| `api-test-reports` | HTML test report, JSON test results | 30 days |
| `integration-test-reports` | Integration test HTML reports | 30 days |

- **Environment**: CI
- **Dependency Caching**: Enabled (cache key based on requirements.txt)

### Database Service:
- **Type**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Host**: localhost
- **Port**: 5432
- **Database**: healthcare_test
- **User**: test_user
- **Password**: test_password
- **Health checks**: Every 10s

## 📈 How to Use the Pipeline

### For Developers:

#### Before Pushing Code:
```bash
# Run tests locally
python -m pytest tests/api/test_simple_api.py -v

# Check formatting
black --check libraries/ tests/ utils/

# Check imports
isort --check-only libraries/ tests/ utils/

# Run security scan
bandit -r libraries/ utils/
```

#### After Push:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Find your commit in the workflow runs
3. Monitor job progress
4. Review test results in summary
5. Download artifacts if needed

### For Pull Requests:
1. Create PR to `main` or `develop`
2. Pipeline runs automatically
3. Review check results in PR
4. All checks must pass before merge
5. Test results appear in PR comments

### Manual Execution:
1. Navigate to **Actions** tab
2. Click "Healthcare Test Automation Pipeline"
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select branch and test suite
5. Click "Run workflow" to start

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Q: Pipeline fails on "Install dependencies"**
A: Missing package in requirements.txt - add it and push

**Q: Database tests fail**
A: PostgreSQL service not ready - check health checks in logs

**Q: Linting errors**
A: Run `black .` and `isort .` locally before pushing

**Q: Security scan finds issues**
A: Download Bandit report, review findings, fix code

**Q: Tests timeout**
A: Add `@pytest.mark.timeout(300)` to slow tests
