# 🔧 GitHub Actions Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Status: Workflows Already Fixed

Your workflow files are **100% up to date**:
- ❌ v3 (deprecated): **0 occurrences**
- ✅ v4 (current): **13 occurrences**
- 🔖 Last commit: `3f318d4` - "Fix: Update actions/upload-artifact and actions/download-artifact from v3 to v4"

---

## 🎯 Why You're Still Seeing the Error

The error message you're seeing is from a **cached/queued workflow run** that:
1. Started **before** the fix was pushed
2. Is using the **old workflow definition** from commit `a2431c1`
3. Cannot be updated mid-run

This is **normal behavior** - GitHub Actions locks the workflow definition when the run starts.

---

## 🛠️ How to Fix: Cancel & Re-run

### Option 1: Via GitHub Web UI (Recommended)

1. **Go to Actions Tab**
   ```
   https://github.com/andreeamiut/HealthcareTestAutomationFramework/actions
   ```

2. **Find the failing workflow run**
   - Look for the run showing the v3 deprecation error
   - It should be from before commit `3f318d4`

3. **Cancel the old run**
   - Click on the failing workflow run
   - Click "Cancel workflow" button (top right)

4. **Trigger a new run**
   - Go to "Actions" tab
   - Select "Healthcare Test Automation Pipeline" or the workflow you want
   - Click "Run workflow" dropdown
   - Click "Run workflow" button

5. **Verify the new run**
   - The new run will use commit `3f318d4` or later
   - Should show ✅ no deprecation errors

---

### Option 2: Via Command Line (GitHub CLI)

```powershell
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 5

# Cancel a specific run (replace RUN_ID with actual ID)
gh run cancel RUN_ID

# Trigger a new workflow run
gh workflow run "Healthcare Test Automation Pipeline"

# Or trigger the other workflow
gh workflow run "healthcare-tests.yml"
```

---

### Option 3: Push Any Change to Trigger New Run

```powershell
# Add the instructions file
git add GIT_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md
git commit -m "docs: Add git push instructions"
git push origin main
```

This will automatically trigger a new workflow run with the fixed configuration.

---

## 🔍 How to Verify the Fix

### Check Workflow Definition Used
When viewing a workflow run on GitHub:

1. Click on the workflow run
2. Look at the top - you'll see the commit SHA
3. **Old run (will fail):** Uses commit `a2431c1` ❌
4. **New run (will work):** Uses commit `3f318d4` or later ✅

### Look for Updated Actions
In the workflow logs, you should see:
```
Run actions/upload-artifact@v4  ✅ (good)
```

Instead of:
```
Run actions/upload-artifact@v3  ❌ (deprecated)
```

## 🚀 Quick Action Checklist

- [ ] Go to GitHub Actions tab
- [ ] Cancel any running workflows showing v3 error
- [ ] Click "Run workflow" to start fresh run
- [ ] Verify new run uses commit `3f318d4` or later
- [ ] Confirm no deprecation errors appear
- [ ] Check workflow completes successfully

## 💡 Prevention Tips

### Set Up Branch Protection
```
Repository → Settings → Branches → Add rule
- Require status checks before merging
- Require branches to be up to date
```

### Enable Dependabot for GitHub Actions
Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

This will auto-create PRs when GitHub Actions get updated!

## 🆘 Still Seeing Errors?

If you trigger a new run and **still** see the v3 error:

1. **Verify you're on the right branch:**
   ```powershell
   git branch
   git log -1 --oneline
   ```

2. **Double-check the files:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content .github\workflows\ci-cd-pipeline.yml | Select-String "artifact@"
   ```

3. **Check GitHub has the latest:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`
   - Verify it shows `@v4` not `@v3`
   - Check the "Latest commit" timestamp

4. **Clear GitHub Actions cache:**
   ```
   Repository → Settings → Actions → Caches
   Delete all caches (if any exist)
   ```

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome

After canceling old runs and starting a new one:

```
✅ All workflow steps pass
✅ No deprecation warnings
✅ Artifacts upload/download successfully
✅ Tests execute and reports generate
✅ Pipeline completes successfully
```

---

**Bottom Line:** Your code is already fixed! Just cancel the old workflow run and start a fresh one. 🎉
